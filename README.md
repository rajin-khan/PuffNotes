## 💭 What is Puffnotes?

**Puffnotes** is a minimalist, local-first, markdown-based note-taking app with one simple goal:

> ✨ Make your messy, vague ideas look smart and structured — in one click.

Built for *lazy writers, distracted students, and tired creatives*, Puffnotes is quiet, beautiful, and powered by Groq’s lightning-fast AI to help you go from **rough thought → finished note** in seconds.

It’s your personal thought polisher.
